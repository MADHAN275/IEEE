    venue: 'Campus-wide',
    duration: '2 hours',
    description: `Network Quest was an interactive treasure-hunt-style event organized by the IEEE Computer Society to test participants’ analytical and problem-solving skills. Teams of four navigated through various checkpoints by scanning QR codes, each unlocking a challenge such as riddles, logic puzzles, or technical questions. Solving one clue revealed the next location, leading teams closer to the final destination.

The event promoted teamwork, quick thinking, and creativity in a fun, gamified setting. Participants enhanced their collaboration, leadership, and communication skills while solving each level’s challenge. The winning team was determined based on both completion time and accuracy.`,

    venue: 'Emmanuel Auditorium',
    duration: '2 hours',
    description: `The IEEE Computer Society at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences held its official inauguration for the 2025 academic year on August 12, 2025, at the Emmanuel Auditorium. The ceremony marked the formal launch of the society’s yearly activities and introduced the newly appointed office bearers. An innovative highlight was a custom-built AI chatbot that served as a co-host, reflecting the society’s focus on practical technology integration.

A cybersecurity demonstration during the event used a simulated phone “hack” to raise awareness about digital safety. The Chief Guest, Dr. Nirmal, delivered an inspiring address, followed by the formal badging of the student leadership team. The inauguration set a strong vision for the chapter, blending academic excellence with innovation and technological responsibility.`,
